The Technology HC is an umbrella HC that will provide strategy and oversight for technology sectors encompassing multiple industries and extensions in RISC-V ISA and ISA ecosystem (e.g. Embedded SIG under the HC will cover topics across industries like Automotive, Controllers, Wearables, etc. and groups like Code Size Reduction, EABI, etc.). This HC will identify gaps across industries and RISC-V groups and create SIGs/TGs/HCs that will address these gaps.  It will be a home for any SIGs/TGs/HCs that are created and represent them to the greater RVI community.  Sign off for other TG/HC work will flow through the Technology HC to the corresponding SIGs under it.  The HC will also help the groups under its umbrella successfully interoperate and influence other groups regarding their topic areas.  Finally, the HC will help its constituents' groups evolve to become a HC or TG as appropriate.
